      The evolution of all organization will gravitate towards the creation of a core of coordinators that are independent of the production. 
How does this core coordinate? Who is steering the direction of the coordinators? Depending on existing immutable governance, 
it will all devolve into a competitive game. It devolves into a game of influence. 
A game of influence among humans has as its currency the number of humans that follow another human.
More specifically, the number of humans that are not autonomous but follow a leader. A leaders influence is measured in the size of his fiefdom. 
This is where bullsh*t jobs come from. As the administrative component of an organization grows, 
the politics grows and the currency of politics is the number of non-autonomous follows in a sub-organization. 
Bullsh*t jobs exists as a proxy of influence within administrative organizations. 
Your job is BS if its only purpose is to serve as a token or currency of someone else’s influence.
